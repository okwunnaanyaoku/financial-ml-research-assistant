    "abstract": "Predicting prices of cryptocurrencies is a notoriously hard task due to the presence of high volatility\nand new mechanisms characterising the crypto markets. In this work we focus on the two major\ncryptocurrencies for market capitalization at the time of the study, Ethereum and Bitcoin, for the\nperiod 2017-2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the predictability of price movements\ncomparing four different deep learning algorithms (Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short\nTerm Memory (ALSTM)) and using three classes of features. In particular, we consider a combination\nof technical (e.g. open and close prices), trading (e.g. moving averages) and social (e.g. users\u2019\nsentiment) indicators used as input to our classi\ufb01cation algorithm. We compare a restricted model\ncomposed of technical indicators only, and an unrestricted model including technical, trading and\nsocial media indicators. The results show that the unrestricted model outperforms the restricted one,\ni.e. including trading and social media indicators, along with the classic technical variables, leads to\na signi\ufb01cant improvement in the prediction accuracy consistently across all algorithms.\nKeywords : Cryptocurrency, Deep Learning, Social Media Indicators, Trading Indicators, Arti\ufb01cial Neural Networks\n1",
