# Financial ML Research Assistant - Implementation Tracker

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup

### Phase 1: Foundation & Standards (Days 1-2)

#### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with minimal code standards and context referencing
- [x] Create .claude/implementation-tracker.md with active todo management
- [x] Set up minimal project structure (essential directories only)
- [x] Create custom /review-code command for minimalism validation
- [x] Build minimal PDF extractor (core PyMuPDF functionality)
- [x] Code review: PDF extractor scored 95/100 (minimal, 1 unused import)

#### üîÑ In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Test PDF extractor with real financial ML papers

#### ‚è≥ Pending Tasks
- [ ] Create paper parser for section detection
- [ ] Build hierarchical chunker

### Phase 2: Core Processing (Days 3-5)
- [ ] Minimal paper parser (essential section detection)
- [ ] Lean hierarchical chunker (core chunking logic)
- [ ] Focused metadata extractor (financial ML entities)
- [ ] Simple configuration system (essential settings)
- [ ] Basic ingestion pipeline (streamlined)
- [ ] Code review: Remove redundancy, ensure simplicity

### Phase 3: Search Infrastructure (Days 6-8)
- [ ] Minimal embeddings generator (SentenceTransformers core)
- [ ] Lean ChromaDB integration (essential vector ops)
- [ ] Simple BM25 indexer (basic keyword search)
- [ ] Streamlined hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- [ ] Basic reranking (essential relevance scoring)
- [ ] Code review: Eliminate duplicate search logic

### Phase 4: Agent System (Days 9-12)
- [ ] Minimal base agent class (shared utilities only)
- [ ] Focused query analyzer (essential classification)
- [ ] Lean retrieval agent (core search orchestration)
- [ ] Simple domain expert (financial ML analysis)
- [ ] Streamlined orchestrator (workflow coordination)
- [ ] Essential prompt templates (concise, effective)
- [ ] Code review: Remove agent redundancy

### Phase 5: Integration & Final Review (Days 13-14)
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline integration (minimal glue code)
- [ ] Real citation system (essential linking)
- [ ] Basic evaluation framework (core metrics)
- [ ] Comprehensive code review (remove all bloat)
- [ ] Final testing with real financial ML queries
- [ ] Documentation cleanup (essential info only)

## Code Quality Metrics
- Max function length: 50 lines
- No duplicate logic tolerance: 0%
- Real functionality requirement: 100%
- Essential imports only: Enforced

## Testing Progress
- [ ] PDF processing with real papers
- [ ] Embedding generation with real text
- [ ] Search retrieval with real queries
- [ ] Agent analysis with real content
- [ ] End-to-end with real research questions

## Next Actions
