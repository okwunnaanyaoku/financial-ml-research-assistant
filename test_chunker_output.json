      "text": "Predicting prices of cryptocurrencies is a notoriously hard task due to the presence of high volatility\nand new mechanisms characterising the crypto markets. In this work we focus on the two major\ncryptocurrencies for market capitalization at the time of the study, Ethereum and Bitcoin, for the\nperiod 2017-2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the predictability of price movements\ncomparing four different deep learning algorithms (Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short\nTerm Memory (ALSTM)) and using three classes of features. In particular, we consider a combination\nof technical (e.g. open and close prices), trading (e.g. moving averages) and social (e.g. users\u2019\nsentiment) indicators used as input to our classi\ufb01cation algorithm. We compare a restricted model\ncomposed of technical indicators only, and an unrestricted model including technical, trading and\nsocial media indicators. The results show that the unrestricted model outperforms the restricted one,\ni.e. including trading and social media indicators, along with the classic technical variables, leads to\na signi\ufb01cant improvement in the prediction accuracy consistently across all algorithms.

      "text": "During the last decade, the global markets have witnessed the rise and exponential growth of cryptocurrencies traded\nand exchanged with a daily market capitalization of hundreds of billions of USD Dollars globally (reaching \u22481 trillion\nas of January 2021). Recent surveys1 report a spike in demand and interest for the new crypto assets from institutional investors, attracted\nby the novel features and the potential rise in value in the current \ufb01nancial turmoil, despite the risk associated with\nprice volatility and market manipulation. Boom and bust cycles often induced by network effects and wider market\u2019s adoption, make prices hard to predict\nwith high accuracy. There is a large body of literature concerning this issue and proposing a number of quantitative\napproaches for cryptocurrency prices prediction [13,15\u201318]. The rapid \ufb02uctuations in volatility, autocorrelations and\nmulti-scaling effects in cryptocurrencies have also been extensively studied [22], also with respect to their effect on\nInitial Coin Offering (ICO) [10,11].",

      "text": "A PREPRINT - FEBRUARY 18, 2021\nAn important consideration that has gradually emerged from the literature is the relevance of the \u201csocial aspect\u201d of\ncrypto trading. The code underlying blockchain platforms is developed in an open-source fashion on Github, recent\nadditions to the crypto ecosystem are discussed on Reddit or on specialised channels in Telegram, and Twitter offers\na platform where often heated debates on the latest developments take place. More precisely, it has been shown that\nsentiment index can be used to predict bubbles in prices [5] and that the sentiment extracted from topic discussions on\nReddit correlates with prices [28]. Open-source development also plays an important role in shaping the success and value of cryptocurrencies [21,25,27]. In particular, a previous work by Bartolucci et al. [2] \u2013 which this work is an extension of \u2013 showed the existence of\na Granger causality between the sentiment and emotions time series extracted from developers\u2019 comments on Github\nand returns of cryptocurrencies. For the two major cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 it has been also shown\nhow including the developers\u2019 emotions time series in prediction algorithms could substantially improve the accuracy. In this paper, we further extend previous investigations on price predictability using a deep learning approach and\nfocusing on the two major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We predict price movements by mapping the punctual price forecasting into a classi\ufb01cation problem: our target is a\nbinary variable with two unique classes, upward and downward movements, which indicate prices rising or falling. In the following we will compare the performances and outcome of four deep learning algorithms: the Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP), the Multivariate Attention Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (MALSTM-\nFCN), the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM).",
